Going to a site does a GET request
normally, returns HTML

REST API?

who a wev sever responds to your requests

ITEN RESOURCE
GET /item/chair
POST /item/chair
PUT /item/chair
DELETE /item/chair

ItemList resources
GET /items

STATELESS

- another key feature is that rest is supposed to be 
stateless

this means one request cannot depend of any other requests
the server knows about the current request, and not any
previous request.
